** eclipse told me 'obnoxious' is 'not correctly spelled'... was it just trying to be... obnoxious???

*** this document is a work in progress! if you find any shortcuts, let me know and I'll add them to the list

P.S. if you see any spelling errors, or if something isn't working correctly, let me know. I'm had a few drinks... :P
